# ICD-10 Codes and HCC Guide

## ICD-10 Codes

ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision) is a standardized system used globally to classify and code diagnoses, symptoms, and medical procedures.

### Structure

ICD-10 codes consist of 3-7 alphanumeric characters:
- First character is always a letter
- Second character is always a number
- Characters 3-7 can be letters or numbers
- A decimal point appears after the third character

**Example**: E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications)

### Purpose

These codes are used for:
- Medical billing and insurance claims
- Tracking disease statistics
- Research and public health monitoring
- Clinical documentation

## HCC (Hierarchical Condition Categories)

HCC is a risk-adjustment model used primarily by Medicare Advantage and some commercial insurance plans to predict healthcare costs based on patient diagnoses.

### Key Features

- Groups ICD-10 codes into categories that represent conditions with similar cost patterns
- Each HCC has a risk score (RAF - Risk Adjustment Factor)
- Higher scores indicate more complex/costly conditions
- Used to adjust payments to insurance plans based on patient population health status

### How They Work Together

1. A patient's ICD-10 diagnoses are documented by providers
2. These codes map to specific HCC categories (not all ICD-10 codes map to HCCs)
3. The HCC scores are calculated annually
4. Insurance plans receive adjusted payments based on their members' collective HCC scores

### Example

- ICD-10 code E11.65 (Type 2 diabetes with hyperglycemia) maps to HCC 19
- This has a higher risk score than uncomplicated diabetes
- The insurance plan receives more funding to care for this patient
