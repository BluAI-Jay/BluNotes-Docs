Published rates associated with ICD-10 codes, but they vary depending on the payment system and context. Let me explain the different types of rates:

## Types of Published Rates

### 1. Medicare Fee Schedule Rates

Physician Fee Schedule: Medicare publishes rates for procedures (CPT codes) but not directly for ICD-10 diagnosis codes
Hospital Rates (DRG): Diagnosis-Related Groups use ICD-10 codes to determine hospital payment rates
Published annually by CMS (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services)

### 2. HCC Risk Adjustment Factors (RAF)

These ARE published rates tied to ICD-10 codes
Each HCC category has a specific coefficient/weight
Published in the CMS Rate Announcement each year
Example: HCC 19 (Diabetes without Complication) might have a RAF of 0.105

### 3. Commercial Insurance Rates

Vary by insurance company
Usually proprietary and not publicly published
Negotiated between providers and insurers

### 4. Workers' Compensation Rates

Some states publish fee schedules that reference ICD-10 codes
Rates for specific injuries/conditions

Where to Find Published Rates
### CMS Resources:

Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (for procedures)
IPPS Final Rules (for hospital DRG rates)
Rate Announcement and Final Call Letter (for HCC coefficients)
Available at cms.gov

Key Point: ICD-10 diagnosis codes themselves don't have direct payment rates. Instead, they:

Justify medical necessity for procedures that DO have rates
Map to payment systems like DRGs or HCCs that determine reimbursement

Influence risk adjustment payments
